# Skyzone → AtomRC Head Tracker Bridge

`Gimbal-tracking-Gemini.ino` turns the Skyzone HT OUT jack into smooth pan/tilt motion on an AtomRC two–servo gimbal driven by an ESP32.  
The project’s goal is to mirror the pilot’s head movement (≈180° usable yaw) while letting the camera sweep its full 270° mechanical travel. To hide the extra 90°, the sketch keeps the gimbal synchronized through most of the range and progressively accelerates the camera near the edges so it can cover the remaining arc without the pilot noticing a hard stop. A light smoothing filter and user-tunable deadband keep the rig steady in turbulent moments.

```

Only `Gimbal-tracking-Gemini.ino` needs to be uploaded to the ESP32. The helper document is a reminder of how the earlier PPM remapper worked and why the interrupt is tagged with `IRAM_ATTR`.

## Hardware overview
- **Input** – Skyzone FPV goggles (tested with 04X PRO) HT OUT jack, emitting head tracking on PPM channels 5 (yaw) and 6 (pitch).
- **Controller** – ESP32 running the sketch, powered from the goggles or a dedicated BEC.
- **Output** – AtomRC gimbal servos on GPIO18 (pan) and GPIO19 (tilt).
- **Power/signal split** – The HT OUT signal is shared: one branch goes to the flight controller as usual, the second branch feeds the ESP32 which regenerates the servo PWM.

## How the firmware works
1. **PPM capture** – GPIO2 uses an interrupt (`ppmInterrupt`) to decode 8 PPM slots. The ISR rejects out-of-range pulses and marks a frame complete when it sees a sync gap (`PPM_FRAME_GAP`).
2. **Channel extraction** – `processPPMFrame` reads channels 5 and 6, applies safety limits, then maps them onto the servo limits. By tweaking `PAN_MIN/MAX` and `TILT_MIN/MAX` you can match any gimbal.
3. **Head ↔ camera ratio** – Because the pilot only rotates about 180° comfortably, most of the range keeps a 1:1 mapping. Near the extremes (where the servo range exceeds the pilot’s), the output gets stretched so the camera sweeps to 270° without noticeable jumps.
4. **Smoothing and deadband** – `updateServos` uses a first-order “slew limiter” governed by `smoothFactor` and `deadband`. The defaults remove micro-jitters but you can tune them at runtime.
5. **Serial tooling** – Through the USB serial monitor you can center the gimbal, dump live channel values, run a travel test, or change tuning parameters, which is handy when the tracker is strapped to a pilot.

## Key settings

| Setting | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PPM_INPUT_PIN` | top of sketch | GPIO wired to HT OUT (must be interrupt capable) |
| `PAN/TILT_PIN` | top of sketch | Servo outputs; move if your AtomRC controller uses other pins |
| `PAN_*` & `TILT_*` | top of sketch | Define the mechanical range and centers for each axis |
| `deadband` | runtime variable | Neutral zone around center to suppress micro-shakes |
| `smoothFactor` | runtime variable | Higher values = slower but steadier motion |

### Serial commands
- `center` – return both servos to their defined centers.
- `debug` – print the raw PPM values and current servo targets.
- `limits` – report the configured min/max angles.
- `deadband <value>` – change the deadband (0–50).
- `smooth <value>` – change the smoothing factor (1–50).
- `test` – run a scripted sweep to check binding or stalled motors.

## Usage checklist
1. Wire the HT OUT signal and ground from the Skyzone goggles to ESP32 GPIO2 and GND. Share the signal with the flight controller if necessary using a simple Y harness.
2. Connect AtomRC pan servo to GPIO18 and tilt servo to GPIO19 (or adjust the pin constants).
3. Flash `Gimbal-tracking-Gemini.ino` with the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (board: ESP32 Dev Module).
4. Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud; when the tracker is stationary run `center` to align the gimbal mechanically.
5. Wear the goggles, move your head slowly through its normal range, and verify the gimbal stays synchronized. If you feel oscillations, raise `smoothFactor`; if latency feels high, lower it instead.
6. Once tuned, disconnect USB power, power the ESP32 from your flight battery/BEC, and strap it to the goggles or the headset strap.


## Operating modes

### 1. Wired PWM (single ESP32)
### ===============================
```
Skyzone HT OUT  ──> GPIO2 (PPM) ──> ESP32 ──> GPIO18/19 ──> AtomRC pan/tilt servos
                              GND ────────────────────────┘
```

Skyzone HT OUT (PPM)  ---->  ESP32 RX GPIO2 (PPM_INPUT_PIN)
GND Skyzone           ---->  ESP32 GND

ESP32 RX GPIO18  ---->  Pan servo signal
ESP32 RX GPIO19  ---->  Tilt servo signal
Servos +V        ---->  BEC 5V
Servos GND       ---->  BEC GND & ESP32 GND

The goggles’ head-tracker signal is read and immediately turned into PWM on GPIO18/19. This is the original “two wires only” setup for benches or when the ESP32 sits close to the gimbal.

### 2. ELRS / CRSF bridge
```
[Goggles ESP32] --PPM--> smoothing --> CRSF stream @420k ------> ELRS TX (bind phrase X)
                                                                ~~~~~ RF ~~~~~
[Drone ESP32] <--------------- CRSF from ELRS RX --------------- packet decode -> servos
```
The goggles-side ESP32 now emits genuine CRSF RC frames on UART1, so any ExpressLRS TX/RX pair behaves exactly like a “real” radio link. Enter the same bind phrase on both ELRS modules, wire their CRSF pads to the ESP32 UART pins, and the link will auto-resync after a brown-out. Only two channels are used (pan & tilt), but you keep the same smoothing, deadband, and failsafe logic as in the wired setup.

### 3. ESP-NOW pair (two ESP32s)
```
Goggles ESP32   Wi-Fi STA + ESP-NOW  ~~~wireless~~~  Drone ESP32
PPM -> filter -> packet             <----MAC pair---->  packet -> servos
```

[TX Goggles ESP32]                          [RX Drone ESP32]
PPM in (GPIO2)                              Servos on GPIO18/19
WiFi STA + ESP-NOW  ~~~~~~wireless~~~~~~>   WiFi STA + ESP-NOW RX

Alim TX : 5V/USB / BEC                      Alim RX : BEC 5V (ou 5V FC)
GND only toward the drone, no need direct wire TX<->RX.


Both ESP32 boards talk directly over ESP-NOW using their Wi-Fi MAC addresses (fill them in at the top of the TX/RX sketches). No router, no FC involvement—just a private wireless bridge with the same smoothing and failsafe behavior.
